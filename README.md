# DAC
Distant Assist Cursor (DAC) is a poster (+ extended abstract) submitted to the ISS 2021 conference.
The goal of DAC is to facilitate remote collaboration for novice users by sharing a virtual cursor. To do so, we focus on a simple, easily reproducible design.

This page will be updated (after submission results) with more details, instructions and figures.
For now, you can download the 3D model of the main support piece (CamProj_2.blend file).
